# FreePHIL docs

This package helps with creating nice documentation pages for projects, which use [(Free)PHIL](https://freephil.readthedocs.io/) to handle complex input parameters.

Currently, it can convert PHIL scope into a Markdown page. The function `phil_to_markdown` returns a string in Makdown format, it is up to user to save it where desired.

## Example

An example usage is in `test_markdown.py`.
